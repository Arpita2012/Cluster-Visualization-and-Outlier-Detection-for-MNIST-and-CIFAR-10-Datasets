# Outlier-Visualization
Outlier Visualization on Image Datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10

Embeddings are generated by:
* image flattening for MNIST dataset 
* Features are extracted using MobileNetV2 for CIFAR-10

Next step is to reduce dimension using PCA or UMAP. 
Further, images of a dataset are clustered using Kmeans or HDBSCAN (configurable) and outlier are identified and plotted.
UMAP plots are used to clearly view the clusters for CIFAR-10
